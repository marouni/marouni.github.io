I had the pleasure of giving a talk in the first [Nantes Scala Meetup to be hosted in the new Talend offices](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Scala-Nantes-User-Group-SNUG/events/261448443/) in Nantes.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing with [Scio](https://spotify.github.io/scio/) for sometime when they asked me if I'm interested in giving a Scala talk, and since the previous talk I gave was about how Talend Pipeline Designer uses Apache Beam under the hood I decided to work on a talk that shows the pros of using a Scala Beam API. That's how the idea of this talk came into existence.
