I had the pleasure to give a talk during the first european Apache Beam summit held in London. I presented Talend Pipeline Designer (previous Talend Data Streams) and how we built a modern Big Data pipeline designer with Apache Beam and finished the talk with a quick demo. The overall summit was pretty good and I had the chance to meet great people from the Apache Beam community.
