I'm a software engineer currently residing in Paris/France and this is my personal blog. I often write my own analysis and experiments with new technologies and ideas in **Distributed Systems**, **Big Data**, **Hadoop** and **Software** in general.
<br><br>
I'm also a humble medival history buff and an avid traveller with a constant urge to discover new places. The photos featured on this site were taken during a trip to Cinque Terre in Italy, a great place if you ask me !
